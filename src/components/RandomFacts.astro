        <div>
            I've been working in frontend development since 2018, and in 2020, I
            decided to delve into mobile development as well. I've been using
            Flutter since version 1.2.x and Angular since version 6 (naturally,
            I've kept up with updates since then).
        </div>
        <div>
            Additionally, I have a passion for nutrition, and I've developed
            ZYME, a calorie tracking app available on android and iOS.
